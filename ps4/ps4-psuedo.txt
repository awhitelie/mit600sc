Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:

Take encrypted text as input
Take list of valid words
Break apart encrypted text to list of words
while words in list are not members of valid words list:
  Shift cipher to get new string of text
  break string of text into list of new words
  increment count by 1
when words in list are members of valid words list
return count #
