Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:

Take encrpyed text as input
set max valid words to 0
set best shift to 0
For the entire range of shifts (27)
  Shift the original text by n
  count the nubmer of valid words
  if the # of valid words is > the max valid words,
    max valid words = valid words in shift n
    best shift = shift n
return best shift


Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:

Take a multi-level encryped string and a list of valid words
While all words in the string are not members of the word list:
  While no words in the string are members of the word list:
    shift the string by 1
    split the string into a list of words
  Move the valid word(s) to a new string
  Move the starting point of the test string to where the last valid word ended

start at index 1
check if the word is in the word list
if the word doesn't match:
  shift by 1
If the word matches:
  return the word
  mark the index
  strip the word from the beginning of the text
